# PyTorch ANFIS
In this repo, you'll see an implementation of an ANFIS using PyTorch.
To use it, simply run the command:

`pip install -e .`

in base directory, and it will install it into your current virtual enviornment.
Don't forget to install all the requirements ahead of time. requirements.txt contains all necessary requirements except for PyTorch, since that installing can vary from machine to machine.

# Demo
To run the demo, move into the function_approx folder and run:

`python interactive.py`
